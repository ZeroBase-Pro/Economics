# ZEROBASE Economic Model

## Introduction

This document outlines the key strategies for optimizing the ZEROBASE economic model. The approach includes visual enhancements, mathematical modeling, and economic model improvements to ensure sustainable growth and efficiency.

## Visual Enhancements 

### **Token Release Curve**
The token release curve illustrates the supply increase over time. Using a sigmoid (S-curve) release function instead of a linear release can help reduce early inflation pressure while accelerating release in later stages before stabilizing. This approach balances early incentives with long-term supply management.

### **Inflation Rate Prediction**
Using token release plans and burn mechanisms, we can predict future circulating supply and inflation rates. Inflation rates are expected to decrease over time as token release slows. This visualization helps monitor inflation levels and adjust policies like buybacks and burns accordingly.
